### AVR CodeVision
 * in project folder, `.c` file is main source code (void main/in while loop) ,<br>
   you can ignore another files because they are 'Code Vision' configs.
   if just `.c` file exist, copy that to new your CodeVision Project (and config it in code wizard)
   
* the file we upload in microcontroller is `.hex` file\
  you can find .hex file in : `PROJECT/Debug/Exe/.hex`
